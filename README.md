# Project Overview

## Introduction

This project began as an initiative to create a GUI for `NMAP` using React. However, as I prepared for my Security+ certification, my focus shifted. I became deeply intrigued by `IDS` (Intrusion Detection Systems) and their mechanisms. My goal is to **explore**, **understand**, and **innovate** how `IDS` systems function, especially by incorporating `AI` capabilities.

## Technology Stack

To achieve this, I will **leverage** the following tools and libraries for the backend:

- **Flask**: for building a scalable and efficient API.
- **Pandas**: for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: for numerical operations.
- **SCIpy**: for advanced scientific computing.
- **TensorFlow**: to integrate machine learning models.
- **Scapy**: for packet manipulation and network tasks.
- **pytest**: to ensure robust and reliable testing.
- **Docker**: for creating containerized, platform-independent applications.

The frontend will be developed using **React.js**, and **Docker** will also be employed to ensure easy deployment and mobility across different systems.

## Phase One: Backend Development

### Objectives

In Phase One, I will **design**, **develop**, and **implement** the backend infrastructure for the tool. This phase will focus on:

- **Incorporating** Nmap capabilities, while more closely **emulating** Wiresharkâ€™s functionality.
- **Integrating** machine learning assistance to enhance packet analysis and intrusion detection.

### Technologies

- Flask
- Pandas
- Numpy
- SCIpy
- TensorFlow
- Scapy
- pytest
- Docker

## Phase Two: Frontend Development

### Objectives

In Phase Two, I will **build** and **optimize** the frontend of the application using React.js. The goal is to:

- **Create** a visually appealing and user-friendly GUI.
- **Establish** seamless communication between the frontend and backend via Flask API.
- **Ensure** fluid interaction and real-time data visualization.

### Technology

- React.js

## Phase Three: Desktop Application Integration

### Objectives

Phase Three will involve **transforming** the web application into a full-fledged desktop application. This will be done by:

- **Integrating** Electron to package the React application.
- **Ensuring** that the desktop application **retains** the responsiveness and features of the web version.

## Future Directions

Once the primary phases are complete and the core functionalities are **refined**, I plan to **explore** further enhancements and potential deployments in real-world scenarios.

This project is designed to **equip** me with a deeper understanding of IDS systems and **demonstrate** the potential of AI in enhancing cybersecurity tools. I am excited to **embark** on this journey and **bring** my vision to life.
