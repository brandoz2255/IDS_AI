# Starting 
Will work on **Phase one** which is the backend then for **Phase Two** I will being working with React!!

## What this project is about!

Essentially My idea for this application started when I wanted to make a GUI for `NMAP` using React but then I moved onto studying for my Security+. 

What fascinated me the most was the `IDS` system that most industries have. I just want to understand how `IDS` systems work under the hood and I want to add some `AI` capabilities to it.


- Flask 
- Pandas
- Numpy
- SCIpy
- tensorFlow
- Scapy
- pytest
- Docker

These libraries in Python are going to be used for the back end as well as Docker. Where the Front end is going to be in React.js. Also Docker is going to be used for easy mobility on all systems for this Web App.

#### Phase one

Phase One will consist of only the Backend of this tool Where I am to have some Nmap capabilities but this will be more closely resembling Wireshark with ML assistance. 

#### Phase Two 

Phase Two will consist of the Frontend the React Application that will communicate with the Backend via Flask API to create a nice fluid eye candy GUI.

- Web App for now once I get all the kinks settled and everything ready once that is done move onto Phase Three

#### Phase Three

Phase Three will consist of Integrating Electron so that it can use the React Application as a fully fledged Desktop Application.
